Future Value (Recursive): 1276.28
Future Value (Optimized Recursive): 1276.28

=== Analysis ===
Recursive Time Complexity: O(n) - Each year involves one recursive call.
Optimized Recursive: O(n) with memoization avoids repeated calculations.

Recursion simplifies the logic but may lead to stack overflows or redundant work for large inputs.
Memoization reduces repeated computations, improving performance for larger timeframes.
